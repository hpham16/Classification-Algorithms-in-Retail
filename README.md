# Classification-Algorithms-in-Retail

In the fast-paced world of retail, understanding what customers want is key to growing a business and offering them a personalized shopping experience. Today, with so many ways for customers to shop and choose products, businesses need smarter tools to keep up. The project introduces new computer techniques to help with this challenge. While older methods might not capture everything about a customer, this paper suggests new approaches, like Decision Trees and Random Forest, that can provide deeper insights. By analyzing detailed data, such as age or shopping history, these techniques can reveal more about customer preferences. The main idea is that using these advanced methods will allow businesses to better understand their customers, tailor their shopping experience, and adapt to future trends more effectively.
